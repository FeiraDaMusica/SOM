## The Project

The S.O.M. (Music Operational System)  is an accelerator of opportunities in the Brazilian music field. 

The S.O.M. is a network of opportunities of the Brazilian music  that connects producers and artists in a dynamic os social network, developed in a digital platform that allows interaction with the most diverse figures of the music industry, building and adding making room for convergences in the production chain of music, between in artistes, events, festivals, producers and brands in an online environment. 

## Background TBN

http://tnb.art.br/

In 2010, the Fora do Eixo Network launched Toque no Brasil (www.tnb.art.br), an online agency platform that followed the social network logic, to integrate, strengthen and boost the relationship between artists, producers and the public. At TNB, artists and producers created their respective profiles, where they could upload all kinds of media (music, photos, videos, texts, etc.), having their portfolio available for dissemination, at the same time that they could interact with each other, leaving messages, "enjoying" and so on. While producers were able to offer space and places for concerts in open calls within the platform, which transformed the site into an incredible curatorial tool, facilitating direct and intermediary contact between producers and artists and implementing the "opportunities" functionality. The site has over 30 thousand artists and 3 thousand registered producers, which were accessed by more than 2.5 million people directly on the platform.

After 9 years, new music business models brought about by the digital environment have been developed and streaming services have become a free solution for a generation unaccustomed to paying for music. However, while this solution emerged, other pains in the music production chain emerged or worsened, such as: the decrease in the audience at concerts, filling in concert schedules and quick access to them, career management of artists in production times independent, new models to control copyright collection and, once again, the need to shorten distances and create new opportunities.

The internet and digital resize the time for instantaneousness and the different sectors of culture, such as music, are challenged to reorganize themselves and to refound business models that generate sustainability and continuity of their actions. It became urgent to create solutions for this new scenario.

Because of this context, from February 15 to 17, 2019 in Fortaleza / CE, a 48-hour hacker marathon was held during the Propulsion Zone, during the Propulsion Zone, which connected musicians, producers, public managers, developers, UX designers, data analysts, game devs, entrepreneurs and other agents of hacking to think and act together for the transformation of digital culture in music.

In this event, TNB's new update is re-founded and presented: the Music Operating System, understanding it as a great space for exchanging products, services and technologies to assist in the formation of the new generation of musicians. made invisible. Setting a new milestone in the history of independent music in Brazil.
